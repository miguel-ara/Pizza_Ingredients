# Pizza_Ingredients
Based on pizza orders, determining the ingredients Pizza Maven should buy in order to become a more efficient restaurant in terms of stock management.
To do so, in the first place you have to run in the python terminal the following command: "pip install -r requirements.txt", which will automatically
download the necessary libraries for the actual program to work correctly. The program is called "maven_pizzas.py" and uses the files given by
Maven Pizzas "order_details.csv", "orders.csv", "pizzas.csv" and "pizza_types.csv" to predict and estimate the ingredients Pizza Maven´s manager should by each week
of the following year. Additionaly, the program generates three files which correspond to a brief report and analysis of the data's quality. These three
generated files are "order_details_informe.csv", "orders_informe.csv", "pizzas_informe.csv" and "pizza_types_informe.csv"

To build such prediction, the program sums up all the pizzas that were ordered last year, differentiating pizza type and size. Then, divides that total 
quantity by 52 (number of weeks in a year) and takes the roof of the result of the division (for example, 300/52 = 5,769 => 6). Once this procediture has
been done for every kind of pizza, we have the number of pizzas of each type ordered in an average week. Now, the program multiplies each pizza´s
ingredientes by the number of pizzas of such type ordered in one week by another factor, related with the size. For each size, we consider the following
units of each ingredient in one particular pizza: {s:1, m:2, l:3, xl: 4, xxl: 5}

Once the number of ingredients has been calculated, leaving room for some misestimation, the final csv is generated with the name "compra_semanal_ingredientes.csv"
This file contains two columns "Ingredient" and "Amount (units)", which is a kind of shopping list Pizza Maven´s manager should follow each week to be efficient
and throw almost no food at all.
